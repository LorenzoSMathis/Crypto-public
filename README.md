# Some notes about this handbook

This handbook is a summary of the Cryptography course (2022/2023). The theory part is based on the course [of professor Christof Paar](https://www.youtube.com/@introductiontocryptography4223)

It can be used online by using the github markdown viewer, some KaTeX formulas may not be rendered correctly (on the Github mobile app). You can clone locally the repository and use Visual Studio Code to read the handbook (the graphical appearance is little bit different).

On `linux`

```bash

cd /where/you/want/to/clone/the/repo/

git clone git@github.com:LorenzoSMathis/Cryptography.git

cd Cryptography && code .

```
